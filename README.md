### Hi there 👋

My name is Jurjen de Jong.

- 🔭✨ I’m currently a PhD candidate at Leiden Observatory, where I work on long-baseline calibration with LOFAR and study the evolution of radio-loud AGN morphologies.
- 👨‍💻 In my previous life, I have been employed as a data scientist and machine learning engineer.
- 🛰️ Interested to learn more about working with satellite data (making pipelines from open data and applying image recognition).
